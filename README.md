## Basic data exploration with Pandas library

### Project Overview
With data from an American bikeshare company in three major cities (Washington, New York City and Boston), this project rolls a **data exploration focused on Pandas library**, by usage of simple statistic methods and descriptive analysis, to display some of the main information in a Python script. It also accepts user inputs to create an interactive experience and answer specific questions or display most accurate raw data frames.  

#### How to run this script
It is recommended run this script using a Python IDE that supports Python 3 (this version was written on Python 3.6 version).

### Bikeshare Data
To this project were used three csv files, one for each city, containing all bikeshare information from January to July (2017). All these files were provided by Udacity and are stored in a .gitignored file. But you can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16FfhNDfAh0DvTIRw9r0plmWZlHPEcBa4) and use it to run this script locally.

Note: the Washington’s csv file doesn’t have “Gender” or “Birth Date” information.
